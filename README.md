# Changes 

The original code is from PresentMon, https://github.com/GameTechDev/PresentMon/commit/405d18cbacb142b5094a1c92fb10331091d32eb9 .
The changes represent Proof-of-Concept code for Endurance Gaming.
Specifically the goals are to prove out how to do the following:
- Detect when a game is launched
- Detect when EnduranceGaming mode should be enabled
- Provide frame-rate of the current game
- Provide GPU utilization or idle data
- Determine which tasks can be done without elevated privileges

Usage: TestEG-x64.exe on a laptop with Windows 10, version 1903 or newer.
- You need two monitors. Move TestEG window to the 2nd display.
- As you launch games and plug/unplug AC, TestEG will update the title-bar
- Format of title bar: TestEG: fps=%d gpu=% EG=%d pid=%d GM=%d DC=%d igfx=%d
- fps= is FPS. It seems to match steam’s FPS counter.
- gpu= is the GPU utilization
- EG= indicates if EnduranceGaming is on. Basically when pid=nonzero and DC=1. 
- pid= is the process-ID of the game identified for EG.
- GM= indicates whether gamemode is on/off. Remember when game process is not in foreground GM=0. If the OS option is disabled, it’s always GM=0. 
- DC= indicates if system is uing battery (i.e. DC=1 on battery).
- igfx= indicates if Intel Integrated Gfx is being used

Other details:
- Works even if GameMode is disabled.
- Works without admin/privilege-escalation.
- The FpsTracker/presentmon logic will regularly ask GameDetectionLogic if an FPS-reading/process-ID pair is a game.
- If the GameMode OS option is enabled, the GameDetectionLogic assigns the game pid when (GM==1 && proposed pid is the active foreground app).
- If GameMode OS option is disabled, the GameDetectionLogic assigns the game pid when (gpu% > 30 && proposed pid is the active foreground app).
- It may take a few seconds for EG=0 to occur after the game exits.

# PresentMon

PresentMon is a tool to capture and analyze [ETW](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb968803%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396) events related to swap chain presentation on Windows.  It can be used to trace key performance metrics for graphics applications (e.g., CPU and Display frame durations and latencies) and works across different graphics APIs, different hardware configurations, and for both desktop and UWP applications.

While PresentMon itself is focused on lightweight collection and analysis, there are several other programs that build on its functionality and/or helps visualize the resulting data.  For example, see
- [CapFrameX](https://github.com/DevTechProfile/CapFrameX)
- [FrameView](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/frameview/)
- [OCAT](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Tools/OCAT)
- [PIX](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pix/download/) (used as part of its [system monitor UI](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pix/system-monitor/))

## Command line options

```
Capture target options:
  -captureall              Record all processes (default).
  -process_name name       Record only processes with the provided exe name.
                           This argument can be repeated to capture multiple
                           processes.
  -exclude name            Don't record processes with the provided exe name.
                           This argument can be repeated to exclude multiple
                           processes.
  -process_id id           Record only the process specified by ID.
  -etl_file path           Consume events from an ETW log file instead of
                           running processes.

Output options (see README for file naming defaults):
  -output_file path        Write CSV output to the provided path.
  -output_stdout           Write CSV output to STDOUT.
  -multi_csv               Create a separate CSV file for each captured process.
  -no_csv                  Do not create any output file.
  -no_top                  Don't display active swap chains in the console
                           window.
  -qpc_time                Output present time as a performance counter value.

Recording options:
  -hotkey key              Use provided key to start and stop recording, writing
                           to a unique CSV file each time. 'key' is of the form
                           MODIFIER+KEY, e.g., alt+shift+f11. (See README for
                           subsequent file naming).
  -delay seconds           Wait for provided time before starting to record. If
                           using -hotkey, the delay occurs each time recording
                           is started.
  -timed seconds           Stop recording after the provided amount of time.
  -exclude_dropped         Exclude dropped presents from the csv output.
  -scroll_indicator        Enable scroll lock while recording.
  -simple                  Disable GPU/display tracking.
  -verbose                 Adds additional data to output not relevant to normal
                           usage.

Execution options:
  -session_name name       Use the provided name to start a new realtime ETW
                           session, instead of the default "PresentMon". This
                           can be used to start multiple realtime capture
                           process at the same time (using distinct names). A
                           realtime PresentMon capture cannot start if there are
                           any existing sessions with the same name.  name is
                           not sensitive to case.
  -stop_existing_session   If a trace session with the same name is already
                           running, stop the existing session (to allow this one
                           to proceed).
  -dont_restart_as_admin   Don't try to elevate privilege.  Elevated privilege
                           isn't required to trace a process you started, but
                           PresentMon requires elevated privilege in order to
                           query processes started on another account. Without
                           it, these processes cannot be targeted by name and
                           will be listed as '<error>'.
  -terminate_on_proc_exit  Terminate PresentMon when all the target processes
                           have exited.
  -terminate_after_timed   When using -timed, terminate PresentMon after the
                           timed capture completes.

Beta options:
  -qpc_time_s              Output present time as a performance counter value
                           converted to seconds.
  -terminate_existing      Terminate any existing PresentMon realtime trace
                           sessions, then exit. Use with -session_name to target
                           particular sessions.
  -include_mixed_reality   Capture Windows Mixed Reality data to a CSV file with
                           "_WMR" suffix.
```



## Comma-separated value (CSV) file output

### CSV file names

By default, PresentMon creates a CSV file named `PresentMon-TIME.csv`, where `TIME` is the creation time in ISO 8601 format.  To specify your own output location, use the `-output_file PATH` command line argument.

If `-multi_csv` is used, then one CSV is created for each process captured and `-PROCESSNAME` appended to the file name.

If `-hotkey` is used, then one CSV is created for each time recording is started and `-INDEX` appended to the file name.

### CSV columns

| Column Header | Data Description | Required argument |

| Hardware: Legacy Flip | Indicates the app took ownership of the screen, and is swapping the displayed surface every frame. |
| Hardware: Legacy Copy to front buffer | Indicates the app took ownership of the screen, and is copying new contents to an already-on-screen surface every frame. |
| Hardware: Independent Flip | Indicates the app does not have ownership of the screen, but is still swapping the displayed surface every frame. |
| Composed: Flip | Indicates the app is windowed, is using ["flip model" swapchains](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3ddxgi/dxgi-flip-model), and is sharing its surfaces with DWM to be composed. |

## Known issues

See [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/GameTechDev/PresentMon/issues) for a current list of reported issues.

### Analyzing OpenGL and Vulkan applications

Applications that do not use D3D9 or DXGI APIs for presenting frames (e.g., as is typical with OpenGL or Vulkan applications) will report the following:
- Runtime = Other.
- SwapChainAddress = 0
- SyncInterval = -1
- PresentFlags = 0
- MsInPresentAPI = 0

In this case, TimeInSeconds will represent the first time the present is observed in the kernel, as opposed to the runtime, and therefore will be sometime after the application presented the frame (typically ~0.5ms).  Since MsUntilRenderComplete and MsUntilDisplayed are deltas from TimeInSeconds, they will be correspondingly smaller then they would have been if measured from application present.  MsBetweenDisplayChange will still be correct, and MsBetweenPresents should be correct on average.

### Measuring application latency

PresentMon doesn't directly measure the latency from a user's input to the display of that frame because it doesn't have insight into when the application collects and applies user input.  A potential approximation is to assume that the application collects user input immediately after presenting the previous frame.  To compute this, search for the previous row that uses the same swap chain and then:

```LatencyMs =~ MsBetweenPresents + MsUntilDisplayed - previous(MsInPresentAPI)```

### Shutting down PresentMon on Windows 7

Some users have observed system stability issues when forcibly shutting down PresentMon on Windows 7.  If you are having similar issues, they can be avoided by using Ctrl+C in the PresentMon window to shut it down.
